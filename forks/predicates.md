## Why retained

Consolidate float-cmp dependencies while preserving the modern f64 comparison behavior used by tests.

## Retained changes

Private modernf64 helpers retained from float-cmp 0.10; optional dependency uses 0.9; local unpublished version.
Read [the existing detail record](../predicates/SOTF_FORK_PROVENANCE.json) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `retained-local-fork`.
Original path: `math-audio/crates/3rdparties/predicates`. Retained source repository/commit: `sotf-3rdparties@bfd07543a9f61040d70f8a1f5aa644fa80c7fb60`.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path sotf-3rdparties/predicates/Cargo.toml --lib
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
