```sh
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features shipping
```

this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
