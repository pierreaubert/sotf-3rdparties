## Why retained

Pin the compatible upstream async task implementation used by the GPUI dependency closure.

## Retained changes

Exact upstream snapshot; no SOTF Rust patch claimed. Pinned head updates a flume development dependency.
Read [the existing detail record](../async-task/Cargo.toml) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `pinned-git-snapshot`.
Archive SHA-256: `74de925ea04c6e119a343691db231f83ca4c728c827a95c58f0304810ef96000`. Pinned commit subject: Update flume requirement from 0.11 to 0.12 (#99).

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features shipping
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
