## Why retained

Align optional pollster with the selected version 1 family.

## Retained changes

Pinned fork commit updates pollster manifest compatibility; imported Rust is unchanged by relocation.
Read [the existing detail record](../rfd/Cargo.toml) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `pinned-git-snapshot`.
Archive SHA-256: `339c614a4ace42f576b4918c384182ac69b8c8ef4c510957b0cd4a32c41c1f51`. Pinned commit subject: Align optional pollster dependency with version 1.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features shipping
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
