## Why retained

Retain the VST3 bindings drop fix used by NIH and the external plugin host.

## Retained changes

Exact fix/drop-box-from-raw branch revision explicitly drops Box::from_raw results; internal COM crates retained.

this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
