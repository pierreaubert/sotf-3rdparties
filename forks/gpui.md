## Why retained

Own the patched GPUI framework, renderer, platform backends and Zed support sources in one self-contained group.

## Retained changes

Thirteen retained toolkit vendor crates plus six exact compatibility-fork support crates; former workspace policies and embedded fonts retained. Per-crate VENDORED/VENDORING notes describe the behavioral patches.
Read [the existing detail record](../gpui/README.md) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `retained-local-fork`.
Original path: `gpui-toolkit/crates/3rdparties`. Retained source repository/commit: `gpui-toolkit@a145af14bd8d9679487f42c0dfb3f50897668a02`.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features shipping
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
