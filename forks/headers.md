## Why retained

Keep the HTTP header dependency on the SHA-1 0.11 crypto family used by the maintained streaming sources.

## Retained changes

sha1 dependency updated from 0.10 to 0.11; compare Cargo.toml.orig and src/common/authorization.rs.
Read [the existing detail record](../headers/Cargo.toml.orig) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `retained-local-fork`.
Original path: `sotf/crates/3rdparties/headers`. Retained source repository/commit: `sotf@a228c40da803c6d0c18ed0e22139878a3c58701f`.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path sotf-3rdparties/headers/Cargo.toml --lib
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
