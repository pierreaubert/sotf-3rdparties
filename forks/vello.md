The renamed local GPUI renderer exposes types from sotf-wgpu. Upstream Vello
depends on the registry package wgpu, whose Device, Queue and TextureView types
have a different Cargo package identity. That prevented desktop chart compilation.

This is a manifest-only adapter: the package is sotf-vello, consumers retain
the vello dependency alias, and its wgpu dependency selects ../wgpu/wgpu under
the wgpu alias. All Rust source remains byte-identical to the cached release.
Cargo.toml.orig records the upstream manifest.

Verify the desktop's actual selected feature combination with:
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features dev-api.
Native UI checks still follow that build. Optional upstream hot_reload and
wgpu-profiler closures are not qualified by this desktop check.

Owner: SOTF dependency maintainers. Review every 90 days and on GPU dependency
updates. Remove this adapter once the upstream renderer and GPUI can share the
selected GPU package identity directly.
