## Why retained

Preserve Apple target support, bitmap expansion, and CSS generic font family behavior.

## Retained changes

Apple mobile cfg/manifest fixes, canvas/source changes; remaining deltas need classification as documented.
Read [the existing detail record](../zed-font-kit/VENDORING.md) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `retained-local-fork`.
Original path: `gpui-toolkit/crates/3rdparties/zed-font-kit`. Retained source repository/commit: `gpui-toolkit@a145af14bd8d9679487f42c0dfb3f50897668a02`.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path sotf-3rdparties/zed-font-kit/Cargo.toml --lib canvas
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.
