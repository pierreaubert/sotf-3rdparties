## Why retained

Retain the Zed screen capture fork used by GPUI platform backends.

## Retained changes

Exact selected Zed fork with macOS compilation fixes; platform support still requires target checks.
Read [the existing detail record](../scap/Cargo.toml) before updating.
This inventory review does not claim a fresh upstream parity or security audit.

## Source provenance

Import kind: `pinned-git-snapshot`.
Archive SHA-256: `8cd50e118ee2e7b2aed8af011a7de588908eb55816336ce650f28cc452c19b33`. Pinned commit subject: Get macos version compiling.

## Validation and removal

From the aggregate `all_of_sotf` directory:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path sotf/Cargo.toml -p sotf-gpui --features shipping
```

These are update gates, not a statement that all platform-specific tests ran for
this relocation. Use the owning consumer's feature set and locked resolution.
Replace this source only when a selected upstream release covers the retained behavior and the listed consumer regression checks pass.

Owner: SOTF dependency maintainers. Inventory reviewed 2026-10-07;
re-evaluate the upstream delta within 90 days and on every update.
Follow [the collection update procedure](../README.md#updating-a-fork).
