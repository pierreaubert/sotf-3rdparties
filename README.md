# Shared third-party sources

This repository owns the patched and pinned third-party sources used by the
sibling Rust workspaces in `all_of_sotf`, including Librespot and the GPUI
framework/platform/support closure. SOTF-owned toolkit crates remain in
`gpui-toolkit`. There is no root Cargo
workspace: consumers use paths to individual manifests, while imported upstream
workspaces retain their internal layout.

[`FORKS.json`](FORKS.json) is the maintenance inventory. Each entry identifies the
upstream source/base, exact revision when known, retained source commit, licenses,
reason, local delta, owner, update checks, and removal condition. Missing upstream
commit information is explicit; a local source commit is not an upstream revision.
Per-fork notes below complement the original upstream README, licenses, manifests,
and existing `VENDORING.md` / `SOTF_FORK_PROVENANCE.json` records, which are preserved.

`rdsd2pcm/src/dsd_reader` moves with its parent and retains its own MIT/Apache
licenses; `rdsd2pcm` itself remains GPL-3.0-or-later. Multi-package sources such as
WGPU, Tract and Librespot retain their workspace manifests and supporting files.

## Updating a fork

1. Start from the exact recorded upstream revision or registry archive. Recover
   missing upstream commit information before claiming parity. Keep a pristine
   reference outside the active checkout for comparison.
2. Read the fork note and retained provenance. Diff the selected upstream source
   against this copy, including Cargo manifests and features. Reapply only changes
   still required; keep behavioral fixes separate from dependency compatibility.
3. Preserve all upstream license/copyright files and attribution. Record the new
   revision/archive digest, patch reason, exact delta, and removal condition in
   `FORKS.json` and the corresponding note. Do not claim unknown upstreaming status.
4. Update every consumer path/patch table together. Root Cargo patches are not
   inherited across sibling workspaces. Preserve existing dependency versions
   when refreshing locks for a source relocation; review any unexpected upgrades.
5. Run `python3 sotf-3rdparties/scripts/verify.py` from the aggregate directory,
   the fork's listed checks, and affected SOTF consumer checks on the relevant
   target. Native/streaming tests that need accounts or audio devices are separate
   explicit acceptance checks. Compile success alone does not prove UI/audio behavior.
6. Record commands, target, results and limitations in the change review. Update
   the aggregate source pin only after the collection revision is committed.

Review upstream deltas at least every 90 days and on each update. Remove a patch
once the selected upstream source supplies equivalent behavior and the consumer
regressions pass. Pinned but otherwise unchanged snapshots are identified as such;
they do not imply a SOTF source patch.

## Relocation

The original shared Rubato/derive/predicate sources came from `math-audio`.
The remaining local forks came from SOTF, SOTF DAW, GPUI Toolkit and Symphonia
Add-ons; pinned Git forks were imported at their existing revisions from local
Cargo caches. The relocation preserves Rust source bytes. Only `dst-decoder`'s
inherited edition/anyhow and `nnnoiseless`'s inherited criterion were made explicit
so those crates no longer rely on their former workspace parents.
Migration integrity and consumer acceptance are recorded in
[`VALIDATION.md`](VALIDATION.md).

## Lint output in SOTF builds

SOTF's `just` build/check/clippy/run/test recipes (including `just gpui`) use
`../scripts/cargo/quiet-thirdparty-lints.py` on macOS and Linux. It reads Cargo's
JSON diagnostics and hides warnings only when every primary source span resolves
beneath this collection. This also filters warnings replayed from Cargo's cache;
no clean or rebuild is needed. First-party warnings, all errors, build-script
messages, and application/test output remain visible. Compiler lint levels and
imported sources are unchanged. The script requires Python 3.9 or newer.

Direct Cargo commands retain full diagnostics for fork maintenance. To apply
the same filtering manually from `sotf`, use:

```sh
python3 ../scripts/cargo/quiet-thirdparty-lints.py cargo check
```

Existing `RUSTC_WRAPPER`/sccache settings are untouched. An explicit
`--message-format` is respected and bypasses filtering. Cargo subcommands without
compiler diagnostics and Windows recipes retain their existing behavior.
