# Third-Party Vendor Notes

This directory contains local copies of external crates. Treat each directory as
an upstream snapshot plus a small local patch stack. Keep upstream README,
CHANGELOG, and generated Cargo metadata intact when practical; put SotF-specific
upgrade notes in each crate's `VENDORING.md`.

## Inventory

The 11-crate GPUI closure (`gpui` through `util_macros` below, including
`gpui_macos` and `gpui_web`) was imported from zed `v1.9.0` as history-free
snapshots by `scripts/import_gpui_upstream.py` (re-runnable: `--skip`,
`--check` drift report). Each closure crate's `VENDORED.md` records its
upstream path, base ref, import exclusions (`examples/`, `benches/`, dev-deps
on `reqwest_client`/`gpui_platform`, GPL-3.0 `zlog`/`ztracing`), and local
patches. `refineable`, `derive_refineable`, `gpui_shared_string`,
`collections`, `gpui_util`, and `media` now resolve from the reviewed
compatibility fork at `3a0ea890ddf8e6247e38c795a960eb18f5182113`.
`gpui_wgpu` and `gpui_windows` predate the import script and remain hand-maintained.

## Migrated Zed Crates

`collections`, `gpui_util`, and `media` were originally imported from Zed
`v1.9.0` as local snapshots. Their preserved source and per-crate provenance
remain in the prior Git history and `VENDORED.md` files. The compatibility fork
`https://github.com/pierreaubert/zed.git` at
`3a0ea890ddf8e6247e38c795a960eb18f5182113` now supplies these three
crates through pinned Git dependencies. The fork records the `gpui_util`
Apache-2.0 license metadata and the reviewed dependency compatibility fixes.
Gitea candidate runs #644, #660, and #669 cover lock resolution, compilation,
and GPUI tests on Linux and macOS. The local directories are removed from the
release Git tree only after this migration; importer defaults and the active
vendor manifest no longer recreate or count them.

## Upgrade Workflow

1. Read the target crate's `VENDORING.md`.
2. Identify the current upstream ref and the target upstream ref.
3. Replace the upstream snapshot, preserving local documentation files.
4. Reapply only the local changes listed in `VENDORING.md`.
5. For each local change, decide whether it is still needed.
6. Run the verification commands listed in the crate-specific file.
7. Update the upstream ref, local changes, and verification date in `VENDORING.md`.
8. If a directory is meant to affect the build, confirm `cargo tree -i <crate>` resolves to the local path.

## Structured Manifest

`gpui_toolkit::vendored_patch_manifest()` mirrors this inventory in code. It is
the release-facing contract for upstream refs, local paths, active/inactive
status, retained local changes, and upgrade verification gates. Update the
crate-specific provenance file (`VENDORING.md` for hand-maintained crates,
`VENDORED.md` for script-vendored crates) and the manifest together when
adding, removing, or changing a vendored patch.

## Documentation Rules

- Do not hide local changes only in source comments.
- Prefer a short local-change inventory over broad prose.
- Mark unknown history as unknown instead of guessing.
- Keep generated or upstream files close to upstream unless a local patch requires otherwise.
- If a local patch should be upstreamed, record that in `VENDORING.md`.
